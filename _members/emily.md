I'm a scientist and science communicator who switched research focus from the stars to the human brain. As an astrophysicist, I used microwave and radio telescopes to study the formation of stars and planets. I'm currently studying for a PhD in Medical Imaging, with a research focus on understanding the effects of radiation treatment on patient outcomes in paediatric brain tumour survivors using structural and diffusion MRI. In my free time, I enjoy wandering around museums, life drawing, attempting to learn languages and finding hidden places in London to explore.
