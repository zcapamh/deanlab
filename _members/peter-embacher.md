I am a postdoctoral researcher  working on stochastic modelling of non-genetic inheritance pathways in Glioblastoma. My background is in Mathematics and Physics, with a focus on scaling limits of interactive particle systems, non-equilibrium dynamics and gradient flows. I'm particularly interested in modelling the behaviour of stochastic, large-scale systems and developing computational tools like MCMC techniques for Bayesian inference and model selection.
